1. Code Optimization:
Avoid Unnecessary Computations: Reuse calculated results where possible instead of recalculating them.
Use Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures: Choose algorithms and data structures that are appropriate for the task at hand. For example, using a hash table for lookups instead of a list.
Inlining Small Methods: Inlining small methods can reduce function call overhead. However, use this sparingly as it can lead to larger binaries.
2. Memory Management:
Use Object Pooling: For frequently created and discarded objects, implement object pooling to avoid unnecessary memory allocations and garbage collection overhead.
Optimize Memory Allocation: Minimize unnecessary allocations, as excessive memory usage can result in increased garbage collection and runtime overhead.
Efficient Data Structures: Use value types (structs) when appropriate to reduce heap allocations.
3. Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations:
Async/Await: For IO-bound operations, use async and await to avoid blocking threads. This can improve scalability by freeing up threads while waiting for IO operations.
Parallel Programming: Use parallelism for CPU-bound tasks to take advantage of multi-core processors. Libraries like Task.WhenAll or Parallel.For in .NET can help.
Avoid Locks When Possible: Use lock-free data structures or other concurrency techniques to avoid bottlenecks due to synchronization.
4. JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation Optimizations:
Profile and Optimize Hot Paths: Use profiling tools (like Visual Studio's Performance Profiler or JetBrains dotTrace) to identify hotspots in your application, and then optimize them.
Enable Tiered Compilation: .NET's JIT compiler offers tiered compilation, where code is first compiled quickly and then optimized over time as the program runs.
5. Avoid Reflection:
Reflection can be slow and resource-intensive, so avoid using it in performance-critical parts of your application. Instead, try to use statically-typed alternatives.
6. Avoid Boxing:
Boxing occurs when a value type is converted to a reference type. It introduces overhead due to memory allocation and can impact performance. Be mindful of scenarios where boxing happens, especially in collections like ArrayList.
7. Use Efficient Libraries and Frameworks:
Use libraries optimized for performance. For instance, prefer System.Text.Json over Newtonsoft.Json for JSON serialization in .NET, as it's faster and uses less memory.
8. Compiler and Runtime Settings:
Enable Optimizations: When building your application, ensure that optimizations are enabled (e.g., using the Release configuration in .NET).
Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO): In .NET, you can take advantage of profile-guided optimizations to optimize hot paths based on runtime data.
9. Minimize Logging and Debugging Overhead:
Avoid excessive logging in production, as writing logs can introduce IO overhead. Use asynchronous logging or conditional logging to reduce runtime impact.
